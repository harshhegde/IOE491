Heart disease is widely acknowledged as one of the top causes of death around the world. The CDC's data collected through telephonic interviews with around 400k people would be valuable to gain an insight into the key predictors of heart diseases and their importance in estimating the chances of heart disease. To increase prediction accuracy, it's crucial to understand the precursors associated with heart disease and look at the different quantitative and qualitative indicators, the data was analyzed carefully and the correlation between the key predictors and the heart disease indicators was found. The performance of models generated using classification algorithms and relevant features was evaluated experimentally, this procedure is discussed in detail below. Three classification algorithms, namely Support Vector Machine, K-nearest neighbor, and Logistic Regression, were applied to the heart disease dataset as a consequence of the exploratory investigation. Each of the three algorithms was analyzed separately and it was found that each of the models was a capable predictor of those without heart disease, only undersampled(balanced) logistic regression provided the specificity worthy of a dual-directional predictive tool.
